Just playing around with Agility.js.

I'm not fond of doing inline html as a multiline JSON string, since Javascript doesn't have a nice way of doing that.
To combat the "ugliness" of the backslash-newline indicator for JSON multiline strings, I wrote a super basic JSON -> CSS parser.
Honestly, calling it a parser is a stretch, but the benefits are already there, as now you can write CSS in JSON code so your Agility objects are easier to visually parse.

See helper.js for how I'm "parsing" and main.js for how I'm using it.
